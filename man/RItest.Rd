Random seed (default: 42)

\details{
The tests are intended for the high dimension low sample size (HDLSS) setting. The idea is to cluster the pooled sample using a clustering algorithm that is suitable for the HDLSS setting and then to compare the clustering to the true dataset membership using the Rand index.
For the original RI test, the number of clusters has to be specified. If no number is specified it is set to the number of samples. 
This is a reasonable number of clusters in many cases. 

However, in some cases, different numbers of clusters might be needed. 
For example in case of multimodal distributions in the datasets, there might be multiple clusters within each dataset. 
Therefore, the modified (MRI) test allows to estimate the number of clusters from the data. 

In case of a really unclear number of clusters, the multiscale (MSRI) test can be applied which calculates the test for each number of clusters up to \code{kmax} and then summarizes the test results using some adjustment for multiple testing. 

These three tests take into account all samples simultaneously. The aggregated (ARI) test instead performs all pairwise FS or MFS tests on the samples and aggregates those results by taking the minimum test statistic value and applying a multiple testing procedure.

For clustering, a \eqn{K}-means algorithm using the generalized version of the Mean Absolute Difference of Distances (MADD) (\cite{Sarkar and Ghosh, 2020}) is applied. 
The MADD is defined as 
\deqn{
\rho_{h,\varphi}(z_i, z_j) = \frac{1}{N-2} \sum_{m\in \{1,\dots, N\}\setminus\{i,j\}} \left| \varphi_{h,\psi}(z_i, z_m) - \varphi_{h,\psi}(z_j, z_m)\right|,
}
where \eqn{z_i \in\mathbb{R}^p, i = 1,\dots,N}, denote points from the pooled sample and 
\deqn{\varphi_{h,\psi}(z_i, z_j) = h\left(\frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=l}^p\psi|z_{il} - z_{jl}|\right),}
with \eqn{h:\mathbb{R}^{+} \to\mathbb{R}^{+}} and \eqn{\psi:\mathbb{R}^{+} \to\mathbb{R}^{+}} continuous and strictly increasing functions. 
The functions \eqn{h} and \eqn{\psi} can be set via changing \code{s.psi} and \code{s.h}.

In all cases, high values of the test statistic correspond to similarity between the datasets. Therefore, the null hypothesis of equal distributions is rejected for low values.
