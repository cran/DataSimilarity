Engineer Metric
}
\description{
The function implements the \eqn{L_q}-engineer metric for comparing two multivariate distributions.
}
\usage{
engineerMetric(X1, X2, type = "F", seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X1}{
First dataset as matrix or data.frame
}
  \item{X2}{
Second dataset as matrix or data.frame
}
  \item{type}{
Character specifying the type of \eqn{L_q}-norm to use. Reasonable options are \code{"O"}, \code{"o"}, \code{"1"}, for the \eqn{L_1}-norm, \code{"I"}, and \code{"i"}, for the \eqn{L_\infty}-norm, and \code{"F"}, \code{"f"}, \code{"E"}, \code{"e"} (the default) for the \eqn{L_2}-norm (Euclidean norm). 
}
  \item{seed}{
Random seed (default: NULL). A random seed will only be set if one is provided. Method is deterministic, seed is only set for consistency with other methods.
}
}
\details{
The engineer is a primary propability metric that is defined as 
\deqn{\text{EN}(X_1, X_2; q) = \left[ \sum_{i = 1}^{p} \left| \text{E}\left(X_{1i}\right) - \text{E}\left(X_{2i}\right)\right|^q\right]^{\min(q, 1/q)} \text{ with } q> 0,}
where \eqn{X_{1i}, X_{2i}} denote the \eqn{i}th component of the \eqn{p}-dimensional random vectors \eqn{X_1\sim F_1} and \eqn{X_2\sim F_2}.

In the implementation, expectations are estimated by column means of the respective datasets.
