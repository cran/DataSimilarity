List of Methods Included in the Package
}
\description{
The dataset contains the subset of methods that are implemented in the \pkg{DataSimilarity} package from the results table of \cite{Stolte et al. (2024)}. 
}
\usage{data("method.table")}
\format{
  A data frame with 42 observations on the following 30 variables that include information on whether or not the method fulfills the theoretical criteria of \cite{Stolte et al. (2024)}. 
  Some criteria are only fulfilled for certain parameter choices of the method ("Conditionally Fulfilled") or do not apply to the method. 
  \code{NA} values mean that there is no information available on whether or not the respective criterion is fulfilled.
  \describe{
